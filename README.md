# sst-kelp
This Google Earth Engine code helps to create a seasonal SST using Landsat imagery. It selects all the available data over a given area and time range to get an averaged SST image, using Landsat 5,7, and 8. The outputs are a CSV file containing the names and properties of the images used in the average, and an image that can be exported as an asset for future use in GEE.
The GEE link can be found here: https://code.earthengine.google.com/254d48cc9d322538ad22cea48d1ff191
